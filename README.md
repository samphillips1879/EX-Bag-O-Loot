# Bag o' Loot

This exercises will help with your comprehension of [command line parameters](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/argv/more-fun-with-sys-argv).

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/cli && cd $_
touch lootbag.py
```

## Instructions

You have an acquaintance whose job is to, once a year, delivery presents to the best kids around the world. They have a problem, though. There are so many good boys and girls in the world now, that their old paper accounting systems just don't cut it anymore. They want you to write a program that will let them do the following tasks.

1. Add a toy to the bag o' loot, and label it with the child's name who will receive it. The first argument must be the word `add`. The second argument is the gift to be delivered. The third argument is the name of the child.

    ```bash
    python lootbag.py add kite suzy
    python lootbag.py add baseball michael
    ```

1. Remove a toy from the bag o' loot in case a child's status changes before delivery starts.

    ```bash
    python lootbag.py remove suzy kite
    python lootbag.py remove michael baseball
    ```

1. Produce a list of children currently receiving presents.

    ```bash
    python lootbag.py ls
    ```

1. List toys in the bag o' loot for a specific child.

    ```bash
    python lootbag.py ls suzy
    ```

1. Specify when a child's toys have been delivered.

    ```bash
    python lootbag.py delivered suzy
    ```


## Requirements

**Write a test before you write implementation code**

```python
# This is only an example. If I find this code in your project
#  I will make you go back and delete it and write your own test.
def test_toys_for_child_can_be_added_to_bag ()
{
    lootBag = Bag()
    lootBag.add_toy_for_child("kite", "suzy");
    self.assertEqual("kite", lootBag.child_items("suzy")[0]);
}
```

1. Items can be added to bag, and assigned to a child.
1. Items can be removed from bag, per child. Removing `ball` from the bag should not be allowed. A child's name must be specified.
1. Must be able to list all children who are getting a toy.
1. Must be able to list all toys for a given child's name.
1. Must be able to set the *delivered* property of a child, which defaults to `false` to `true`.

## Bonus Features

1. Write a response for the argument `python lootbag.py help` that lists all of the possible arguments, and what they do.
1. Create a shortcut combination of arguments that can remove *all* toys from the bag for a child who has been deemed naughty.
